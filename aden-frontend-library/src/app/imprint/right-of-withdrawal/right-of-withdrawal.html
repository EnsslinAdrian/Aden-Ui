    <h1>Right of Withdrawal</h1>

    <h2>Right of Withdrawal for Consumers</h2>
    <p>
      <em>
        A consumer is any natural person who concludes a legal transaction for purposes that are not
        predominantly attributable to their commercial or independent professional activity.
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without stating reasons.
      The withdrawal period is 14 days from the day of contract conclusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us
      (Adrian En&szlig;lin, Schweizerhof 2, 86609 Donauw&ouml;rth,
      E-Mail: <a href="mailto:aden.mail@web.de">aden.mail@web.de</a>)
      by means of a clear declaration (e.g. a letter sent by post or an email)
      of your decision to withdraw from this contract.
      You can use the attached sample withdrawal form for this purpose, but it is not mandatory.
    </p>

    <p>
      To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient that you send the notification of
      the exercise of your right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period expires.
    </p>

    <h2 style="color: #d32f2f;">Expiration of the Right of Withdrawal</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Important notice for digital content:</strong><br>
      The right of withdrawal expires in the case of a contract for the provision of digital content
      not supplied on a physical data carrier (e.g. software, UI components, code downloads)
      if the Provider has begun to perform the contract after the consumer has:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        expressly agreed that the Provider may begin performance of the contract before
        the withdrawal period expires, and
      </li>
      <li>
        acknowledged that by agreeing, they will lose their right of withdrawal when
        the Provider begins performance (e.g. by logging into the platform or accessing the source code).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Consequences of Withdrawal</h2>
    <p>
      If you withdraw from this contract, all payments received from you will be refunded
      immediately and no later than fourteen days from the day we receive the notification of your withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The refund will be processed via the same means of payment used for the original transaction
      (processed through our partner <strong>Lemon Squeezy</strong>).
      In no case will you be charged any fees for this refund.
    </p>

    <h2>General Description of the Service</h2>
    <p>Provision of a web-based platform for Angular developers with access to digital content such as UI components, technical documentation, and learning guides via the website.</p>

    <h2>Explanations for the Implementation of the Service</h2>
    <p>
      Through our website <strong>https://adenui.com</strong>, we provide a web-based platform for Angular developers.
      Users can register for free and create a user account. Through the user account, access to freely available content is possible.
      Additionally, paid premium content, such as advanced UI components and in-depth developer guides, can be unlocked for a fee.
      The use of the platform and its content is exclusively online via the browser. Physical delivery of products does not take place.
    </p>

    <h2>State of Compliance with Requirements</h2>
    <p>We are committed to digital accessibility and aim to design our website so that it is fully accessible to all users. Therefore, we are continuously working to fully implement the requirements of the Accessibility Strengthening Act (BFSG) and the Accessibility Strengthening Act Ordinance (BFSGV).</p>
    <p>Our website implements the specifications according to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):</p>
    <p>
      In the development of the website, fundamental accessibility measures were implemented. These include a semantic HTML structure, support for screen readers, largely keyboard-navigable functions, as well as sufficiently high color contrasts and legible font sizes. Accessibility is continuously improved as part of ongoing website development.

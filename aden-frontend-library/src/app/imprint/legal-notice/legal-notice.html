    <p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to demand information about your
      archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data at any

      <li>If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
        entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of

      <li>If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be
        weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to
        demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data &ndash; with the exception of their
      archiving &ndash; may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements
      or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited
      by the European Union or a member state of the EU.</p>
    <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
    <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or
      inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption program.
      You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from
      &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
    </p>
    <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
    <h3>Encrypted payment transactions on this website</h3>
    <p>If you are under an obligation to share your payment information (e.g. account number if you give us the
      authority to debit your bank account) with us after you have entered into a fee-based contract with us, this
      information is required to process payments.</p>
    <p>Payment transactions using common modes of paying (Visa/MasterCard, debit to your bank account) are processed
      exclusively via encrypted SSL or TLS connections. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether
      the address line of the browser switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the
      appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.</p>
    <p>If the communication with us is encrypted, third parties will not be able to read the payment information you
      share with us.</p>

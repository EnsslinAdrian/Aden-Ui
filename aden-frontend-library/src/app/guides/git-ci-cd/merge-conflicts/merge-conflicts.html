      Merge conflicts are not an exception for me, but a normal part of working with Git.
      They occur precisely when Git cannot clearly decide which changes are correct.

      In this guide, I show how I <span class="highlight-text">recognize merge conflicts,

      hectic trial and error.

    <h2>1. Recognizing Merge Conflicts</h2>
    <p class="section-desc">
      When I start a merge and Git cannot proceed automatically, Git aborts the process.
      This does not mean the merge failed, but rather it is intentionally paused.

    <h2>2. Reading Merge Conflicts</h2>
    <p class="section-desc">
      After Git has paused the merge, it marks the affected sections directly in the file.
      These markers show me exactly where Git could not make a decision.

    <h2>3. Resolving Merge Conflicts</h2>

      Once I have decided, I remove the conflict markers completely and bring the file
      into a valid state. Only then do I tell Git that the conflict is resolved.

      Merge conflicts cannot always be avoided, but with a few fixed rules, they remain

      <app-notice noticeType="tipp"
        noticeText="If I am uncertain, I abort the merge with <code>git merge --abort</code> and start it again later. This is not a step backward, but control.">
      </app-notice>

      <app-notice noticeType="warning"
        noticeText="I never resolve merge conflicts under time pressure. Haste is the most common cause of broken merges.">

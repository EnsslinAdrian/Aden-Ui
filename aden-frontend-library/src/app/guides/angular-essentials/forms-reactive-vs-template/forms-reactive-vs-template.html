  <!-- INTRO -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <p class="intro-text">
      Angular offers us two ways to build forms.
      <strong>Template-Driven</strong> is often the first encounter: It feels simple, almost magical. Minimal code, quick results.
    </p>
    <p class="intro-text" style="margin-top: 16px;">
      But as requirements grow (complex validation, dynamic fields, unit tests), I often hit a wall with it.
      That’s why I rely on <span class="highlight-text">Reactive Forms</span> in professional projects. Here’s why.

  <!-- 1. TEMPLATE DRIVEN -->
  <section class="code-section">
    <h2>1. Template-Driven Forms (The "Easy" Way)</h2>
    <p class="sub-text">
      Almost everything happens in the HTML here. We use <code>[(ngModel)]</code> for two-way binding.
      This is great for a quick login form or prototypes, but the "single source of truth" lies in the template, not in the code. This makes testing difficult.
    </p>

  <!-- 2. REACTIVE FORMS -->
  <section class="code-section">
    <h2>2. Reactive Forms (The "Pro" Way)</h2>
    <p class="sub-text">
      With Reactive Forms, we explicitly define the structure in TypeScript. The HTML becomes just the "dumb" display.
      The model in the code is the truth. The data flow is synchronous and predictable.
    </p>

  <!-- 3. VERDICT -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>3. When to Use What?</h2>
    <p class="sub-text">
      Technically, both approaches have their merits. Here’s my decision-making guide:
    </p>

    <div class="comparison-grid">

      <!-- Template Box -->
      <div class="compare-box template">
        <h4>Template-Driven</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Simple forms (Login, Newsletter)</li>
          <li>✅ Prototyping / MVP</li>
          <li>❌ Complex Validation dependencies</li>
          <li>❌ Unit Testing logic is hard</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <!-- Reactive Box -->
      <div class="compare-box reactive">
        <h4>Reactive Forms</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Scalable Enterprise Apps</li>
          <li>✅ Dynamic Fields (FormArray)</li>
          <li>✅ Complex Validation Rules</li>
          <li>✅ Easy to Unit Test (No HTML needed)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <!-- THE GOLDEN RULE -->
    <div class="golden-rule">
      <h3>The Golden Rule: Consistency</h3>
      <p>
        Regardless of pros and cons, I have one iron rule:
        <strong>I never mix both concepts in a single project.</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:10px;">
        I decide on one approach at the start (usually Reactive) and stick to it – even for the smallest checkbox.
        Nothing confuses a team more than seeing <code>[(ngModel)]</code> in file A and <code>formControlName</code> in file B.

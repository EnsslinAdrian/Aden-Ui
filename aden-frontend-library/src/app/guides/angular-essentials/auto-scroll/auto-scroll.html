  <!-- 1. INTRO -->
  <section class="content-section">
    <p class="intro-text">
      This is one of the very first configuration changes I make in every new Angular project.
      By default, Single Page Applications (SPAs) retain the scroll position when navigating between pages.
    </p>
    <p class="intro-text" style="margin-top: 16px;">
      <strong>The scenario:</strong> A user reads a long article, scrolls all the way down, and clicks "Next Article".
      <br>
      <strong>The problem:</strong> Angular swaps the content, but the user suddenly stares at the footer of the new page and has to manually scroll up. <span class="highlight-text">This ruins the user experience.</span>
    </p>

      I built this demo to show the difference. Scroll down in the mockup and click the button.
      Pay attention to where you land on the "Detail Page".

      Forget manual hacks like <code>window.scrollTo(0,0)</code>. Angular has this feature built directly into the router.
      We just need to enable it in <code>app.config.ts</code>.
